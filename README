SeekThemUp is a Shoot them up game developed in Ruby using Rubygame and OpenGL.

It's more a little experimentation than a real game project, but it might get fun to play ^^


HOW_TO_INSTALL?

- install ruby game: http://rubygame.org/wiki/Installation_Instructions
- install ruby-opengl: gem install ruby-opengl
- use the "Switch Tags" menu to select a revision or stay on the bleeding edge
- git-clone SeekThemUp using the read-only git url: git clone git://github.com/xpac27/SeekThemUp.git


HOW_TO_PLAY?

- go in the SeekThemUp folder and type: ./run.bash
- use WASD keys to move your ship and your mouse's pointer to shoot!
